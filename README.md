For the moment the tools are the next:

# Token Bruteforcer

* As you all know, the first part of a Discord token is the ID of that person encrypted in base64, this tool generates the exact random termination that is checked in the Discord API, there is the possibility of using a webhook to be able to notify when a token is valid.
You just have to put the ID of your victim, AND ENJOY!
