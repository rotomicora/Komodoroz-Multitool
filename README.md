# Token Bruteforcer

* As you all know, the first part of a Discord token is the ID of that person encrypted in base64, this tool generates the exact random termination that is checked in the Discord API, there is the possibility of using a webhook to be able to notify when a token is valid.
You just have to put the ID of your victim, AND ENJOY!

This tool checks the tokens that you enter in the .txt file saved in data/token_checker/tokens.txt, that's where you have to put the tokens to check them, the tokens are not included, this tool uses discord api to check tokens
